            My targeted audience is for people age 16 on up who live near the southeast parts of Idaho which want to know what events are happening in their area and to check the weather when planning things outdoors. Also, it will be for those who are planning on traveling there but want to keep up with the weather and events happening in the area.

                Hailee age 24, loves to keep up with all the events within a couple of hours from where she lives. Most of the events she goes to are outdoors, so she always has to check on the weather before making her plans. She needs a website where it can provide the information for fun events near her and how the weather is going to be.

                Shane age 36, is going to go visit southeast Idaho soon. He loves doing anything outdoors and exploring all nature but he wants to know what events are going on that week and what the weather is going to look like. Shane needs a website to provide him with fun events to attend when on his trip and to make sure the weather will be clear.

                Hailee has the weekend off of school, so she wants to go on a little trip. She wants to spend time outdoors in nature, but she also wants to know of any fun events happening that weekend. She goes to my website and saw that there was an event in Soda Springs that she is so excited to go to! Now she just needs to pack for the trip.

                Hailee is planning a weekend trip to Soda Springs, but she isn't sure if she should pack a summer outfit or a fall outfit for this outdoors event. She goes on my website and saw that it would be 70 degrees and slightly windy, so she decided to take a light jacket just in case. She’s ready for her trip now!
            </li>

                Shane wants to take a trip to southeast Idaho in a few weeks and see all the nature there, but he also wants to get to know the community a little too. He came across my website and sees an event that is happening the same week he is heading up there. He is really interested in going to this event and getting to know the people who live there.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Shane wants to check the weather a week before his trip up to Idaho because last trip he didn’t, and the weather was terrible for doing outdoor activities. He goes to my website again and sees that all the days he is visiting it will be all sun no rain and 80 degrees. Perfect weather for him to spend time outdoors. 
            </li>

                Hailee has a friend coming up to visit her, so she wants to go on a little mini trip and show her around. To make sure the weather is good because her friend gets cold easily, she goes to my website and sees that it will be partly cloudy but sunny at 65 degrees. She then tells her friend that she might want to bring a light coat since she gets cold very easily. They are excited to explore nature and her friend is happy she won’t freeze.
